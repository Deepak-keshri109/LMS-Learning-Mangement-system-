        <h2>About Our Learning Management System</h2>
        <p>
            Our Learning Management System (LMS) provides a seamless experience for both educators and learners.
            Designed to empower education, our platform offers a wide range of features that allow students to
            access course materials, track their progress, and communicate with their teachers. Teachers can easily
            manage courses, grade assignments, and provide feedback to students, while administrators can monitor
            the overall progress of the institution.
